run_sort_dji_log.bat and run_sort_dji_log.sh are the same script in Windows CMD shell and Mac/Linux shell code format.

As it is well known sometimes Dlog-M has better color torlerence than Dlog, so with DJI drone like Mavic 4 pro, sometimes you may mix shoot both Dlog and DlogM footages.

There's no good way to figure out what is the actual log format by just watching the footage, but this info is recorded in the SRT file, so this script just checks the SRT files then sort files into different folders.
